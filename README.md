> Yuki-chan is a multi-purpose, easy to use and fun discord bot made in Python.

You can get a list of the commands by reading the [documentation](https://github.com/ken-soares/Yuki-chan-discordbot/Documentation.md) made by my friend [Naitik-Sotgiu](https://github.com/Naitik-Sotgiu)

If you ever encounter an issue or want a certain feature (if I am able to implement it, that is), feel free to dm me on discord `灰色子猫#2013` or open an issue in this repo

also, you can invite the bot on your server using [this link](https://canary.discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=926836893121912852&permissions=8&scope=bot)

And here is [my website](https://ken-soares.github.io) if needed 😊
